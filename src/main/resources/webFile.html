    <h1>Threads In Java</h1>
    </br></br>
    <p>
        Threading is a facility to allow multiple tasks to run concurrently within a single process. 
        Threads are independent, concurrent execution through a program, and each thread has its own stack.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Java, threads can be implemented in two ways. One is by 'Extending Thread Class' and the other 
        way is by 'Implementing Runnable Interface'.
    </p>
    <p>Extending Thread Class is required to 'override run()' method. The run method contains the actual 
        logic to be executed by thread. Creation of thread object never starts execution, we need to call 
        'start()' method to run a thread. Examples gives you more details. Other methods supported by 
        Threads are given below.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>join():</b> It makes to wait for this thread to die. You can wait for a thread to finish by 
            calling its join() method.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>sleep():</b> It makes current executing thread to sleep for a specified interval of time. 
            Time is in milli seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>yield():</b> It makes current executing thread object to pause temporarily and gives control
             to other thread to execute.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>notify():</b> This method is inherited from Object class. This method wakes up a single thread 
            that is waiting on this object's monitor to acquire lock.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>notifyAll():</b> This method is inherited from Object class. This method wakes up all threads 
            that are waiting on this object's monitor to acquire lock.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>wait():</b> This method is inherited from Object class. This method makes current thread to wait
             until another thread invokes the notify() or the notifyAll() for this object.
        </li>
    </ul>
